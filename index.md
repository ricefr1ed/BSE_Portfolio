# High Performance Spectrum Audio Monitor
This device takes in audio through a 3.55 mm port and analyzes it. It then displays the audio frequency on an LED screen.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is to have a fully finished audio monitor with ease of use and ease of portability. I will have added two pieces of glass and a stand to make the LED Screen usable.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is implementing code to allow the LED Screen to display the audio frequency of audio ran into a audio splitter and into the Arduino. I needed to use resistors, capacitors, soldering material, and a female audio stereo jack to put between my Arduino and the computer audio.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was hooking up my LED screen to the Arduino and programming the Arduino to show words on the LED Screen. I researched how to do so on Google and the Arduino Community Site, and ended up finding a guide that helped. I used the guide and managed to get my LED Screen to work. However, along the way, I faced issues involving the code itself, and had to reinstall my Arduino IDE to solve that issue. Now I know to troubleshoot my code in a variety of ways, not just reviewing the code over and over again.
